<h2 align="left">Easy Login App using Flutter</h2>
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-brightgreen">

This repository contains a basic code for developing a login screen in Flutter. You can adapt it easily in any project. You will be able to change colors, icons, sizes, etc. Moreover, it uses a BloC/provider service to manage ui data and validations. Check the code and play with it. :)

Feel free to use for your own projects. You will only need to clone or donwload the project (and give it a star!).

HERE you can include new colors and change the general color (icon color, button color, etc).

lib/widgets/background_color.dart

lib/utils/constants.dart
HERE you can modified some general values related to size, names, etc.
